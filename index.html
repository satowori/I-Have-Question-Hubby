            <h1> Happy Valentine's Day My Hubby </h1>
            <p> I just want to thank you for being the sweetest boy alive and for taking care of me. You do so much for me everyday just by being you and I am so incredibly lucky that I had the honor of meeting you. Since the day I met you, you have had an impact on me, and have changed my perspective on everything and just make me want to be a better person. You are my favorite person to yap to even though I donâ€™t like talking. You are my favorite person to play games with, despite me raging and quitting most of the time. You are just my favorite person. You donâ€™t get upset with me, even when I understand there are times you would want to. You are just so gentle with me. You are literally so perfect in my eyes, my heart aches when Iâ€™m not with you. Thank you for reading me bedtime stories every night and for appreciating my snores (you are so silly for that). You literally put timers to remind me to take my meds. I'M SOBBING YOU ARE SO PERFECT. I canâ€™t wait to live somewhere in Italy or Japan with 19238823219837387213 babies and 839438479183723 Buddys with you. You are my forever valentine baby. MWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ðŸ’• - Your Handsome Wife Jade. </p>
